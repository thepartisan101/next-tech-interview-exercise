Using the library you built at home, [fetch some financial securities data](#using-our-securities-quotes-api) (also known as stock prices), and use it to populate a client-side component with their percentage change for the day. It could look something like the following.

We are more interested in how you work than in how much code you write. Treat this like a pair programming session, we are here to help so ask us questions and let us know what you are doing and why. You can use Google or any other resources you would like.

We're not expecting you to complete this exercise, do only as much as you can within the time that we have.

## Getting started

1. Clone the exercise with `git clone git@github.com:Financial-Times/next-tech-interview-exercise.git`
2. Install the dependencies with `npm install`
3. Start the app with `npm start`
4. Run the tests with `npm test`
2. Add your library to `lib/fetch.js`
5. To get developing, have a look in `app.js`

## Using our Securities Quotes API

To fetch the day's percentage change for a security you can use our Securities Quotes API.

## Task review
- Front end: Define minimum set of components: Ticker area + ticker components [name + daily change(%)]
- Back end: call FT market data API, retrieve data and filter response to needed data.

**Important points**
- API can't be accessed without API keys after trying it in the browser. 

**Workaround**
- Found the docs by playing with the URL, used the playground to see the API response structure.
- Created the fectch.js function in case I get access.
- Copied JSON response from playground to the repo to use as mock data

## Steps taken
### Front End

1. Create basic component for the tickers as a handlebars template
2. Add test data in app.js (tickers and % values) to get the template close to the desired look

### Back End

3. Created fetch.js getStockData()  function to test endpoint, confirmed it can't be accessed. 

### Front End
4. Modified the stocks sample array to add floats with several decimals as in the API response, added a function to round the numbers
5. Modified template and styles to get the tickers closer to FT's landing page look. Added typography and color packages from FT's Origami library.
6. Imported JSON mock data from a real API response into app.js, created a mapping object to assign clean ticker names to those given by the API.
7. Created a helper function to style conditionally the ticker's 1 Day % Change based on the value being positive or negative
